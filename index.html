    <h1>All about Poppy Playtime and Project: Playtime</h1>
    <h2>Poppy Playtime</h2>
    <p>Poppy Playtime is an abandoned toy factory and you get chased by Huggy Wuggy, your head almosts gets ripped off by Bunzo Bunny, the hardest characters in my opinion are the Mini Huggies.</p>
    <p>And last but not least, she grabs you with her arms, Mommy Long Legs!</p>
    <h2>Project: Playtime</h2>
    <p>Boxy Boo (aka. Project: Playtime). Boxy Boo is a new character that just released on Mob Entertainment's YouTube channel. And he can hide in his star box and jump out at you with his sharp neck and square face.</p>
